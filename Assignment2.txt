				Tuples

1. convert tuples to list

example_Tuple = (1,2,3,"hello","fruits")

# converting the tuple to list using list()
example_List = list(example_Tuple)

print(example_List)

output:
[1, 2, 3, 'hello', 'fruits']


2. Write a program to calculate direction and magnitude of the vector described by the following points.
A = (20,30)
B = (30,40)

import math
import numpy

# importing required libraries
import numpy
import math


# function definition to compute magnitude o f the vector
def magnitude(vector):
    return math.sqrt(sum(pow(element, 2) for element in vector))


# computing and displaying the magnitude of the vector
print('Magnitude of the Vector:', magnitude(numpy.array([30,40])))


------------don't know how to find the direction of the vector 




3. Write a program to demonstrate data types that can be elements of a tuple.

# Different types of tuples

# Empty tuple
my_tuple = ()
print(my_tuple)

# Tuple having integers
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)

# tuple with mixed datatypes
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
print(my_tuple)

# nested tuple
my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
print(my_tuple)
Output

()
(1, 2, 3)
(1, 'Hello', 3.4)
('mouse', [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))

Another example: 

my_tuple = ("hello")
print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'str'>

# Creating a tuple having one element
my_tuple = ("hello",)
print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'>

# Parentheses is optional
my_tuple = "hello",
print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'>
Output

<class 'str'>
<class 'tuple'>
<class 'tuple'>
