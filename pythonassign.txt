1. Write a Python code to calculate Permutation (5,3)

import itertools

a = [5,3]

permut = itertools.permutations(a)

for i in list(permut):
    print(i)

output: (5, 3)
	(3, 5)


2.  # write the python code to find the combination (15,3)

from itertools import combinations

combi = combinations([15,3],2)

for i in list(combi):
    print(i)

output: (15, 3)


3.Write a Python code that takes the degree as input from the user and convert it into radian.


# taking input from the user in integer
degree = int(input("Enter the temperature in degree: "))

PI = 3.14159  # giving the value of pi 

radian = degree * PI / 180 # formula to convert the degree to radian

print("The temperature in radian is: ", radian)

output: 

Enter the temperature in degree: 55
The temperature in radian is:  0.9599302777777778


4. Write a Python code that inputs input from the user and calculate its square root.


import math

# taking the input from the user in integer

number = int(input('Enter the number you want square root of: '))

squareRoot = math.sqrt(number) # importing the math module to find out the sqrt of the number


print(f'The square root of {number} is ', squareRoot)

output: The square root of 25 is 5


5. Write a Python code to calculate LCM of (25,55)


# giving the input to the two numbers

num1 = 25
num2 = 55

if(num1 > num2):
    maximum = num1
else:
    maximum = num2
while(True):
    if(maximum % num1 == 0) and (maximum % num2 == 0):
        print(maximum)
        break
    maximum+= 1

output: 275


6. Ask enter to enter two numbers (say, a and b). Generate two random numbers
   between those two numbers and find a combination of these two newly generated 
   random numbers. 


import random
from itertools import combinations
a = int(input("enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("enter the second number: "))
randomNumbers = [random.randint(1,10),random.randint(1,10)]
twoVariables = [a,randomNumbers,b]   # generating two random numbers
                                                                # between those numbers
print(randomNumbers)
print(twoVariables)

# no finding the combinations of the two newly generated number

int1 = combinations(randomNumbers,2)

for i in list(int1):
    print(i)

output:
enter the first number: 2
enter the second number: 2
[1, 7]
[2, [1, 7], 2]
(1, 7)


7. Divide 1000 by 3 and print the answer with only 5 numbers after decimal.

answer = 1000 / 3

print(format(answer,".5f"))

output: 

333.33333


8. Write a program to convert 108 to binary.

import math

# declaring the variable and passin the decimal to the corresponding variable

dec_number = 108

#converting to the binary number using bin()
bin_number = bin(dec_number)
print(bin_number)

# converting back to the decimal number
print(int(bin_number,2))

output: 

0b1101100
108



9. Write a program to convert 1008 to hexadecimal.


import math

# declaring the variable to pass the decimal value

dec_number = 1008

hex_number = hex(dec_number)
print(hex_number)

# converting back to the hexadecimal number which has the base of 16
print(int(hex_number,16))

output: 

0x3f0
1008



10. Write a summary of everything you learnt in this class.

To be precise there are lots of things that i learnt from this class that i cant even comprehend.
I learned about variables, integers, operators, strings, list , tuples and how to implement and play 
with them in different places . Due to excessive involvement between teacher and other students as 
a beginner i had the chance as well as it was an golden opportunity for me to learn new terminologies.
I researched and learned about them. As a matter of fact, due to assignments given by Janak sir i had 
a better understanding on how to code and of course how to google to solve variety of  problems.
